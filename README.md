# Safe-delete
Safe delete the files in shell to ./trash that can be restored later
To use the scripts simple do the following

    chmod +x sfrm
    chmod +x unsfrm
    chmod +x emptytrash
    
    sudo cp sfrm /usr/bin/
    sudo cp unsfrm /usr/bin/
    sudo cp emptytrash /usr/bin/
This will add the sfrm,unsfrm and emptytrash to your command line and u can use them easily.
